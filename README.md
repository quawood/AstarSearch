# A* Search

This respository holds a "game" that allows you to find the shortest distane between two points in a grid given some obstacles in between.
The problem was approached with respect to generalizing path finding to non-grid-like environments such as any arbitrary graph.
The A* search algorithm can be used to do this

Within this project also exists a visual graph creator, which I will later integrate A* search with to find shortest paths in arbitrarily create graphs.
